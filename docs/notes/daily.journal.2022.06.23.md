vscode autoformatting upon copy pasting jsx code in React, is putting quotes on the onChange event handler. It can be tricky to find what really happened why the error is occuring as code looks exactly the same as the tutorial.

we first used react useEffect to set the name value in localStorage to the name value in our state in memory. Then, to have our state in memory be initialized from localStorage, we used Window.localStorage.getItem(name), and if there is nothing in there, then we'll initialize it to an empty string as a default.
